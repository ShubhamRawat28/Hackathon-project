					Situated in the Chamoli district, in the Garhwal region, this scenic
					place is one of the most famous skiing destinations in India. Once in
					Auli, you should head straight to Joshimath. It is the centre of all
					the tourist attractions in Auli. Whether it is a ropeway to Auli or a
					trek towards Badrinath, all the mountaineering expeditions start here.
					It houses the popular Chenab Lake with breathtaking views. Another
					Auli attraction is the Chhatra Kund, a pretty little lake surrounded
					by pine, deodar and oak trees. The hill station also gives the perfect
					view of Nanda Devi, the second highest peak in India. Sounds amazing,
					right?

					environment with snow reflecting the sun rays and the sweet breeze
					flowing by. Chopta is the perfect place for sightseeing, trekking,
					camping, bird watching,
